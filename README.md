# Ice_Stealth_Game

Small project I'm working on inspired by Jet Set Radio and Metal Gear Solid. 
Thanks to Cris Bradfield for his tutorial on vision/aim and duklin5 for all the help with circle detection.

Circle around the enemies to dunk them in the ice, to beat the tank boss circle the barrels and get the tank to run into it.
